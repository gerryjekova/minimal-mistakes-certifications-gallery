## What I Learned

* Core principles and values from the Agile Manifesto and their practical application
* Different agile frameworks including Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP)
* Techniques for effective user story creation and management
* Strategies for sprint planning, execution, and retrospectives
* Methods for estimating effort and managing backlogs effectively
* Approaches to continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)
* Test-driven development (TDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD) practices
* Agile team dynamics and effective communication strategies
* Scaling agile practices for larger organizations and complex projects

## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply these agile principles in daily software development activities, from structuring sprint cycles to writing effective user stories that focus on customer value. The emphasis on iterative development has transformed how I approach problem-solving, leading to more regular feedback cycles and improved product quality.

These skills have been particularly valuable in fostering a more collaborative development environment, where cross-functional team members share ownership of outcomes rather than working in isolated specialties.
