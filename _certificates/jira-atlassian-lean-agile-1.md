## What I Learned

* Creating and configuring different project types in Jira Cloud
* Setting up Scrum and Kanban boards for various team workflows
* Managing issues, epics, stories, and tasks in the Jira environment
* Implementing custom workflows to match team processes
* Creating and managing sprints for iterative development
* Using JQL (Jira Query Language) for advanced issue filtering and reporting
* Configuring dashboards to track project progress
* Integrating Jira with other development tools in the Atlassian ecosystem

## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply these Jira skills to streamline project tracking and team collaboration, creating structured workflows that enhance visibility and productivity. The ability to customize Jira to fit specific team processes helps ensure that our agile implementation aligns with our actual working patterns rather than forcing us into rigid frameworks.

This knowledge particularly helps in bridging the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, as Jira provides both detailed technical tracking for developers and clear high-level progress visualization for managers and clients.
