## How I'm Using These Skills

I've applied these principles to create a dedicated workspace that enhances focus while supporting physical comfort during long periods of computer work. The structured approach to workspace organization has helped me maintain better work-life boundaries and reduce context-switching time.

These skills proved especially valuable as remote work became more prevalent, enabling me to maintain high productivity levels regardless of physical location while avoiding the burnout that can come from poor work-home separation.
