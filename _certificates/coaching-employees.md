## What I Learned

* Frameworks for identifying individual strengths and development opportunities
* Techniques for delivering constructive feedback that motivates rather than discourages
* Methods for creating personalized development plans aligned with both organizational and individual goals
* Strategies for conducting effective coaching conversations that drive action and accountability

## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply these coaching techniques to help team members reach their full potential by focusing on their strengths while providing structured support for growth areas. The emphasis on asking powerful questions rather than simply providing solutions has transformed how I approach leadership conversations.

These skills have been particularly valuable for developing high-potential team members who need different types of support at various stages of their growth. The ability to tailor coaching approaches to different learning styles and personality types has helped me create more effective development experiences that drive both individual and organizational success.
