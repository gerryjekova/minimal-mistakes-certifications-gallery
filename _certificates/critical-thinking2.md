## What I Learned

* Distinguishing between facts, opinions, and reasoned judgments in information evaluation
* Identifying and mitigating common cognitive biases that impair decision quality
* Applying structured frameworks for problem decomposition and analysis
* Developing techniques for evaluating the credibility of information sources
* Recognizing logical fallacies and flawed reasoning in arguments
* Implementing systematic decision-making processes for complex situations
* Practicing metacognition to improve awareness of one's own thinking processes
* Creating effective approaches for generating and evaluating alternative solutions
* Balancing analytical and intuitive thinking for more robust decisions

## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply these critical thinking frameworks to analyze complex situations more systematically, considering multiple perspectives and identifying potential biases before reaching conclusions. This structured approach has significantly improved the quality of my decision-making, especially in ambiguous situations where information is incomplete or contradictory.

These skills have been particularly valuable when evaluating competing priorities, assessing risks, and making strategic decisions with long-term implications. By implementing the systematic thinking processes covered in this certification, I've been able to make more objective decisions based on evidence rather than assumptions, and to articulate my reasoning more clearly to stakeholders.
