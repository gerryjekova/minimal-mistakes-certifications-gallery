## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply these teamwork principles to contribute effectively to group efforts beyond simply completing my assigned tasks. The focus on being an active, engaged team member rather than a passive participant has transformed how I approach collaborative work.

These skills have been particularly valuable in cross-functional teams where diverse perspectives and working styles require heightened communication and adaptability. Understanding that being a good team member isn't just about individual performance but about enhancing collective success has made me more attentive to team dynamics and opportunities to support others while still delivering on my responsibilities.
