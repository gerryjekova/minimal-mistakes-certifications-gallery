## What I Learned

* Recognizing and mitigating common cognitive biases that cloud judgment
* Applying structured analytical frameworks to evaluate information quality
* Distinguishing between facts, opinions, and reasoned judgments
* Asking powerful questions that reveal underlying assumptions
* Evaluating the credibility of information sources and claims
* Breaking down complex problems into manageable components
* Considering alternative perspectives before reaching conclusions
* Making decisions with incomplete information under uncertainty

## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply these critical thinking techniques when evaluating project options, weighing different approaches, and making decisions under uncertainty. The frameworks have helped me recognize my own biases and approach problems with greater objectivity.

These skills have proven particularly valuable in stakeholder discussions and requirements gathering, where distinguishing between needs and wants requires careful analysis and thoughtful questioning. The ability to recognize flawed reasoning has strengthened both my technical decisions and my communication with team members.
