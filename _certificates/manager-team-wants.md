## What I Learned

* Frameworks for understanding what team members actually want from their managers
* Techniques for balancing authority with approachability in leadership positions
* Methods for providing meaningful recognition that motivates different personality types
* Strategies for creating growth opportunities aligned with team members' career aspirations
* Approaches to delivering feedback that promotes development rather than defensiveness

* Practices for demonstrating genuine care without overstepping professional boundaries
* Strategies for making difficult decisions while maintaining team trust and respect

## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply these leadership principles to create a management approach that balances task achievement with genuine human connection. By focusing on what actually matters to team members—rather than following generic management playbooks—I've been able to build stronger working relationships based on mutual respect and aligned goals.

These skills have been particularly valuable in adapting my leadership style to diverse team members with different needs and preferences. The emphasis on authentic leadership that responds to team members' actual desires (rather than assumptions about what they want) has helped me develop a more effective and personally satisfying approach to management.
