## What I Learned

* Developing strategic thinking and vision-setting abilities
* Building effective communication patterns that inspire and align teams
* Creating accountability structures that empower rather than micromanage
* Cultivating emotional intelligence and self-awareness as leadership foundations
* Balancing decisiveness with inclusive decision-making approaches
* Fostering innovation and calculated risk-taking within teams
* Establishing trust through consistency, transparency, and integrity

## How I'm Using These Skills

I've integrated these leadership habits into my approach to project management and team collaboration, shifting from a purely task-oriented mindset to a more vision-driven leadership style. 

These principles have particularly improved how I handle challenging conversations, delegate responsibilities, and create space for team members to develop their own leadership capabilities. The focus on balancing strategic thinking with day-to-day execution has transformed how I prioritize and communicate objectives.
