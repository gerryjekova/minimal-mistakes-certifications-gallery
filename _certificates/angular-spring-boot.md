## What I Learned

* Setting up an integrated development environment for Angular and Spring Boot projects
* Implementing reactive programming patterns for asynchronous data handling
* Creating RESTful APIs with Spring Boot WebFlux for non-blocking operations
* Designing responsive user interfaces with Angular's reactive forms
* Implementing proper error handling across both frontend and backend
* Managing state effectively in complex web applications
* Techniques for secure communication between frontend and backend
* Optimizing application performance through reactive data streams
* Testing strategies for reactive applications

## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply these full-stack development techniques to build modern web applications that handle data streams efficiently and provide responsive user experiences even under high load. The reactive programming paradigm has transformed how I approach asynchronous operations and state management in complex applications.

These skills have been particularly valuable for developing applications that need to handle real-time data updates or process large amounts of information without blocking the user interface. The combination of Angular and Spring Boot provides a powerful toolkit for creating enterprise-grade applications with a focus on both developer productivity and exceptional user experience.
