* The CLEAR Method for Goal Setting:
  - **Categorize:** Group related objectives
  - **Level:** Assess impact vs. effort
  - **Eliminate:** Remove non-essential tasks
  - **Actionable:** Break down into steps
  - **Review:** Regular progress checks
* Advanced techniques for managing competing priorities
* Methods for maintaining focus amid distractions

### Implementation Mastery
* Creating realistic timelines without sacrificing ambition
* Building flexibility into goal structures

## Real-World Applications

These prioritization skills have transformed my approach to:

### Project Management
* Turned vague objectives into measurable targets
