* Managing application state and data flow between components
* Using Angular directives for DOM manipulation and enhanced functionality
* Optimizing Angular applications for performance and maintainability

## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply these Angular fundamentals to build dynamic, responsive web applications with clean architecture and efficient data flow. The component-based approach has significantly improved how I structure frontend code, making it more maintainable and reusable.

These skills have been particularly valuable for creating interactive user experiences that handle complex data interactions while maintaining performance. Angular's structured approach to frontend development has transformed how I approach web application architecture, enabling me to build more robust solutions for clients.
