## What I Learned

* Setting up and configuring Jira Cloud for agile project management

## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply these Jira Cloud skills to create structured yet flexible project environments that support adaptive planning and continuous delivery. By implementing digital Kanban boards and sprint management tools, I can visualize workflow bottlenecks, track team velocity, and ensure transparent communication about project status.

These skills have been particularly valuable for managing distributed teams, as Jira Cloud provides a central platform for collaboration regardless of team members' locations, helping us maintain alignment around priorities and progress.
