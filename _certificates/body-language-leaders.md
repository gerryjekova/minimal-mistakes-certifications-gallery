## What I Learned

* Techniques for projecting confidence and authority through posture, stance, and movement
* Methods for recognizing and interpreting team members' non-verbal cues and emotional states
* Strategies for aligning verbal messages with supporting body language for greater impact
* Approaches to managing nervous habits and physical tells during high-pressure situations

## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply these non-verbal communication techniques to enhance my leadership presence in both in-person and virtual environments. Understanding the subtleties of body language has improved my ability to "read the room" during meetings and presentations, allowing me to adjust my approach based on unspoken feedback.

These skills have been particularly valuable when delivering difficult messages or navigating high-stakes conversations, where conscious control of my non-verbal signals helps ensure my intentions are clearly communicated. The awareness of how body language impacts perception has become an essential component of my leadership toolkit.
