## What I Learned

* Understanding the key concepts and architecture behind RESTful APIs
* Working with common data exchange formats including JSON and XML
* Implementing API requests using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* Navigating API documentation to find endpoints and parameters
* Authenticating to APIs using various security methods (API keys, OAuth, etc.)
* Testing API endpoints with specialized tools and environments
* Handling API responses and error conditions effectively
* Evaluating API design for usability, efficiency, and security
* Identifying common API integration challenges and solutions

## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply this API knowledge when integrating different systems and services, allowing me to work effectively with both internal and external data sources. Understanding API fundamentals has enabled me to leverage existing services rather than building everything from scratch, significantly increasing development efficiency.

These skills have been particularly valuable when working with third-party platforms, allowing me to confidently navigate documentation, test endpoints, and implement robust integrations. The ability to understand both the consumption and creation sides of APIs has given me a more holistic perspective on modern application architecture and data exchange.
