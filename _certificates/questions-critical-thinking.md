## What I Learned

* Formulating open-ended questions that stimulate expansive thinking
* Using the Socratic method to guide others toward their own insights
* Creating question frameworks that progress from surface to deep understanding
* Recognizing when to ask divergent versus convergent questions
* Avoiding common questioning pitfalls that shut down critical thinking
* Employing active listening techniques to build on responses
* Designing question sequences that progressively deepen analysis
* Creating psychological safety for authentic inquiry and exploration

## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply these questioning techniques in team discussions and problem-solving sessions, helping guide conversations beyond surface-level solutions toward more thoughtful analysis. These skills have been particularly valuable in requirements gathering and user research, where the right questions can uncover hidden needs and assumptions.

The ability to ask effective questions has enhanced my leadership approach, enabling me to coach team members toward their own discoveries rather than simply providing answers. This has fostered greater ownership and intellectual engagement across projects.
