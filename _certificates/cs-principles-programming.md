## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply these fundamental computer science principles across multiple programming contexts, ensuring my code remains efficient, maintainable, and scalable regardless of the specific language or framework I'm working with. The problem-solving approaches and algorithmic thinking have improved how I tackle complex challenges, breaking them down into manageable components.

These foundational skills serve as my mental model when designing software solutions, allowing me to focus on the core logic and structure before diving into language-specific implementations. The ability to think at this abstract level has made me more versatile across different programming environments and has accelerated my learning curve when adopting new technologies.
