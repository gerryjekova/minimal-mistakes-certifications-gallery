## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply these Canva web design skills to rapidly prototype website concepts and create simple but effective web presences for projects that don't require complex backend functionality. This approach is particularly valuable for creating landing pages and portfolio sites with a professional appearance without extensive coding.

The ability to quickly design responsive websites has been especially useful for testing design concepts with users before investing in full custom development. Canva's intuitive interface allows me to focus on visual communication and user experience without getting bogged down in technical implementation details.
