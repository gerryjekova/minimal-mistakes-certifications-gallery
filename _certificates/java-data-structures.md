## What I Learned

* Implementing and working with fundamental data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues
* Leveraging Java's Collections Framework for efficient data management
* Using appropriate map implementations (HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap) for different scenarios
* Understanding time and space complexity considerations for different data structures
* Implementing and traversing tree structures in Java
* Working with graphs and associated algorithms for complex relationship modeling
* Selecting optimal data structures based on access patterns and operations
* Implementing custom data structures for specialized requirements
* Optimizing code performance through appropriate data structure selection
* Using generics to create type-safe, reusable data structures

## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply these data structure concepts to design more efficient algorithms and solutions in Java applications. By selecting the right data structure for each specific problem, I'm able to optimize both performance and memory usage while maintaining clean, readable code.

These skills have been particularly valuable when working with large datasets or performance-critical applications where the choice of data structure significantly impacts overall system efficiency. The deeper understanding of Java's Collections Framework and the ability to implement custom data structures when needed has expanded my toolkit for solving complex programming challenges.
