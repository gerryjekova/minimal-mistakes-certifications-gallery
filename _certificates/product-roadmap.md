## What I Learned

* Developing product roadmaps that balance vision with practical execution
* Structuring roadmaps to communicate effectively with different audiences
* Prioritizing features and initiatives based on strategic value

## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply these roadmapping techniques to translate product vision into actionable plans that teams can rally behind. This structured approach to planning helps create alignment across engineering, design, marketing, and business stakeholders.

These skills have been particularly valuable in facilitating more productive conversations about product direction, turning abstract goals into concrete steps while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to changing requirements and market feedback.
