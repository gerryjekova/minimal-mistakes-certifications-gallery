## What I Learned

* Techniques for eliciting and documenting clear project requirements
* Methods for stakeholder analysis and engagement
* Frameworks for needs assessment and problem definition
* Approaches to solution scope definition and validation
* Strategies for identifying and managing business value
* Practices for effective requirements management throughout the project lifecycle
* Techniques for process modeling and business rule analysis
* Methods for integrating business analysis and project management activities

## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply these business analysis techniques to strengthen the requirements gathering and validation phases of my project management work. By focusing more deeply on understanding the true business needs behind project requests, I'm able to deliver solutions that more effectively address core problems rather than just fulfilling stated requirements.

These skills have been particularly valuable for improving stakeholder alignment and minimizing scope changes during project execution. The ability to speak both the language of business stakeholders and technical team members has helped me translate between these groups and ensure project deliverables achieve the intended business outcomes.
