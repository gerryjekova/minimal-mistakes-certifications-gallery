## What I Learned

* Frameworks for assessing business requirements and translating them to technical specifications
* Methods for evaluating platform architecture, performance, and scalability
* Criteria for comparing hosted versus self-hosted ecommerce solutions
* Techniques for assessing API capabilities and integration ecosystems
* Strategies for evaluating developer experience and technology stacks
* Approaches to comparing customization capabilities versus out-of-box functionality
* Methods for analyzing total cost of ownership including development and maintenance
* Frameworks for security evaluation and compliance requirements
* Strategies for evaluating platform vendor stability and roadmap alignment

## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply these evaluation frameworks when advising on ecommerce technology decisions, helping to ensure that platform selections align with both immediate business needs and long-term technical strategy. The structured approach to requirements gathering has been particularly valuable in uncovering hidden needs that might otherwise surface as costly surprises later in implementation.

These skills have transformed how I approach technology selection decisions beyond just ecommerce, providing a comprehensive evaluation methodology that considers both technical and business perspectives. The ability to effectively communicate the trade-offs between different platforms has helped bridge the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders during critical technology decisions.
