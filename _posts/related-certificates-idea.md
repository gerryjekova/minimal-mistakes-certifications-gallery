## What I Learned

* Understanding the fundamental concepts of cloud computing and AWS architecture
* Navigating the AWS Management Console with confidence
* Creating and managing S3 buckets for secure and scalable storage solutions
* Setting up basic EC2 instances and understanding their role in cloud infrastructure

## Skills Unlocked

**Completed:** February 27, 2025  
**Duration:** 22 minutes  
**Issued By:** LinkedIn Learning  
**Certificate ID:** cbf756200f465b8e073414c51ab8c6a6489c3eb7c2de619f00a2a0914e99cf29f

This certification covers techniques for thinking on your feet and delivering organized, coherent responses with little to no preparation time, a crucial skill for meetings, Q&A sessions, and unexpected speaking opportunities.

{% include gallery caption="Click to view the full certificate" %}

## What I Learned

* Implementing frameworks for structuring impromptu responses clearly and logically
* Managing anxiety and building confidence when speaking without preparation
* Using the PREP method (Point, Reason, Example, Point) for organized responses
* Leveraging personal experiences and knowledge to illustrate key points effectively
* Employing bridging techniques to handle difficult or unexpected questions

## How I'm Using These Skills

I apply these impromptu speaking techniques in various professional contexts, from team meetings and client interactions to networking events where unexpected questions arise. The structured approach to organizing thoughts quickly has increased my confidence in high-pressure communication situations.

These skills have been particularly valuable in leadership roles where I'm often called upon to provide insights or make decisions on the spot. By implementing effective frameworks for impromptu responses, I've been able to deliver more thoughtful, clear, and impactful communications even without preparation time.

## Now, Let's Add a "Related Certificates" Feature! ðŸ”„

Here's how to implement a feature that will automatically show related certificates based on categories and tags:

### Step 1: Create the Include File

First, create a new file at `_includes/related-certificates.html` with this content:

```html
{% comment %}
  Show related certificates based on categories and tags
{% endcomment %}

<div class="related-certificates">
  <h2 class="related-title">Related Certificates</h2>
  
  <div class="grid__wrapper">
    {% assign maxRelated = 3 %}
    {% assign minCommonTags = 1 %}
    {% assign maxRelatedCounter = 0 %}
    
    {% for certificate in site.certificates %}
      {% assign sameTagCount = 0 %}
      {% assign commonTags = '' %}
      
      {% for tag in certificate.tags %}
        {% if certificate.url != page.url %}
          {% if page.tags contains tag %}
            {% assign sameTagCount = sameTagCount | plus: 1 %}
            {% capture tagmarkup %} <span class="label label-default">{{ tag }}</span> {% endcapture %}
            {% assign commonTags = commonTags | append: tagmarkup %}
          {% endif %}
        {% endif %}
      {% endfor %}
      
      {% if sameTagCount >= minCommonTags and certificate.url != page.url %}
        {% if maxRelatedCounter < maxRelated %}
          <div class="grid__item">
            <article class="archive__item">
              <div class="archive__item-teaser">
                <img src="{{ certificate.header.teaser | relative_url }}" alt="{{ certificate.title }}">
              </div>
              <h3 class="archive__item-title">
                <a href="{{ certificate.url | relative_url }}" rel="permalink">{{ certificate.title }}</a>
              </h3>
              <p class="archive__item-excerpt">{{ certificate.excerpt | markdownify | strip_html | truncate: 160 }}</p>
            </article>
          </div>
          {% assign maxRelatedCounter = maxRelatedCounter | plus: 1 %}
        {% endif %}
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    
    {% if maxRelatedCounter == 0 %}
      <p>No related certificates found at this time.</p>
    {% endif %}
  </div>
</div>
```

### Step 2: Add Some Styling

Add this to your `assets/css/main.scss` file (or create it if it doesn't exist):

```scss
---
---

@import "{{ site.theme }}";

/* Related Certificates Styling */
.related-certificates {
  margin-top: 3em;
  padding-top: 1.5em;
  border-top: 3px solid rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3);
}

.related-title {
  margin-bottom: 1em;
  font-size: 1.5em;
  color: #ff00ff;
  text-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.5);
}

.related-certificates .grid__wrapper {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 1.5em;
}

.related-certificates .grid__item {
  flex: 1 0 300px;
  max-width: 350px;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

.related-certificates .grid__item:hover {
  transform: translateY(-5px);
  box-shadow: 0 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 
              0 0 20px rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3);
}

.related-certificates .archive__item-teaser img {
  border-radius: 8px;
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3);
}
```

### Step 3: Implement in Your Certificate Files

You've already seen I added this line in both certificate templates:

```markdown
{% include related-certificates.html %}
```

Just add that line at the end of all your certificate markdown files.

### Step 4 (Optional): Manual Related Certificates

If you want more control, you can manually specify related certificates like I did in the Impromptu Speaking example:

```yaml
related_certificates:
  - how-to-speak-so-people-want-to-listen
  - how-to-present-and-stay-on-point
```

Then modify the include file to use these if available:

```html
{% if page.related_certificates %}
  <div class="grid__wrapper">
    {% for cert_name in page.related_certificates %}
      {% assign certificate = site.certificates | where: "slug", cert_name | first %}
      {% if certificate %}
        <!-- Display certificate here (same code as above) -->
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
{% else %}
  <!-- Automatic related certificates logic -->
{% endif %}
```

## The Magic Behind This Feature ðŸª„

What makes this feature awesome:

1. **Automatic discovery**: It finds related certificates based on shared tags without you having to manually link them

2. **Visual consistency**: The neon styling fits perfectly with your site's theme

3. **Encourages exploration**: Visitors will naturally click through to explore more of your certificates

4. **SEO boost**: Internal linking between related content helps search engines understand your site structure

5. **Flexible implementation**: Use automatic discovery or manually specify exactly which certificates to show

Would you like me to refine any part of this? Or shall we create markdown files for a few more of your certificates?
