```

## Now, Let's Add a "Related Certificates" Feature! ðŸ”„

Here's how to implement a feature that will automatically show related certificates based on categories and tags:

### Step 1: Create the Include File

First, create a new file at `_includes/related-certificates.html` with this content:

```html
{% comment %}
  Show related certificates based on categories and tags
{% endcomment %}

<div class="related-certificates">
  <h2 class="related-title">Related Certificates</h2>
  
  <div class="grid__wrapper">
    {% assign maxRelated = 3 %}
    {% assign minCommonTags = 1 %}
    {% assign maxRelatedCounter = 0 %}
    
    {% for certificate in site.certificates %}
      {% assign sameTagCount = 0 %}
      {% assign commonTags = '' %}
      
      {% for tag in certificate.tags %}
        {% if certificate.url != page.url %}
          {% if page.tags contains tag %}
            {% assign sameTagCount = sameTagCount | plus: 1 %}
            {% capture tagmarkup %} <span class="label label-default">{{ tag }}</span> {% endcapture %}
            {% assign commonTags = commonTags | append: tagmarkup %}
          {% endif %}
        {% endif %}
      {% endfor %}
      
      {% if sameTagCount >= minCommonTags and certificate.url != page.url %}
        {% if maxRelatedCounter < maxRelated %}
          <div class="grid__item">
            <article class="archive__item">
              <div class="archive__item-teaser">
                <img src="{{ certificate.header.teaser | relative_url }}" alt="{{ certificate.title }}">
              </div>
              <h3 class="archive__item-title">
                <a href="{{ certificate.url | relative_url }}" rel="permalink">{{ certificate.title }}</a>
              </h3>
              <p class="archive__item-excerpt">{{ certificate.excerpt | markdownify | strip_html | truncate: 160 }}</p>
            </article>
          </div>
          {% assign maxRelatedCounter = maxRelatedCounter | plus: 1 %}
        {% endif %}
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    
    {% if maxRelatedCounter == 0 %}
      <p>No related certificates found at this time.</p>
    {% endif %}
  </div>
</div>
```

### Step 2: Add Some Styling

Add this to your `assets/css/main.scss` file (or create it if it doesn't exist):

```scss
---
---

@import "{{ site.theme }}";

/* Related Certificates Styling */
.related-certificates {
  margin-top: 3em;
  padding-top: 1.5em;
  border-top: 3px solid rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3);
}

.related-title {
  margin-bottom: 1em;
  font-size: 1.5em;
  color: #ff00ff;
  text-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.5);
}

.related-certificates .grid__wrapper {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 1.5em;
}

.related-certificates .grid__item {
  flex: 1 0 300px;
  max-width: 350px;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

.related-certificates .grid__item:hover {
  transform: translateY(-5px);
  box-shadow: 0 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), 
              0 0 20px rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3);
}

.related-certificates .archive__item-teaser img {
  border-radius: 8px;
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3);
}
```

### Step 3: Implement in Your Certificate Files

You've already seen I added this line in both certificate templates:

```markdown
{% include related-certificates.html %}
```

Just add that line at the end of all your certificate markdown files.

### Step 4 (Optional): Manual Related Certificates

If you want more control, you can manually specify related certificates like I did in the Impromptu Speaking example:

```yaml
related_certificates:
  - how-to-speak-so-people-want-to-listen
  - how-to-present-and-stay-on-point
```

Then modify the include file to use these if available:

```html
{% if page.related_certificates %}
  <div class="grid__wrapper">
    {% for cert_name in page.related_certificates %}
      {% assign certificate = site.certificates | where: "slug", cert_name | first %}
      {% if certificate %}
        <!-- Display certificate here (same code as above) -->
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
{% else %}
  <!-- Automatic related certificates logic -->
{% endif %}
```

## The Magic Behind This Feature ðŸª„

What makes this feature awesome:

1. **Automatic discovery**: It finds related certificates based on shared tags without you having to manually link them

2. **Visual consistency**: The neon styling fits perfectly with your site's theme

3. **Encourages exploration**: Visitors will naturally click through to explore more of your certificates

4. **SEO boost**: Internal linking between related content helps search engines understand your site structure

5. **Flexible implementation**: Use automatic discovery or manually specify exactly which certificates to show

Would you like me to refine any part of this? Or shall we create markdown files for a few more of your certificates?

# More Glowing Certificates for Your Collection! âœ¨

Here are two more markdown files for your technical certificates - I've added relevant tags that will help create connections between your certificates using that fancy Related Certificates feature we discussed.
